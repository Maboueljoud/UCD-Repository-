Part 2

Their are many things outlined to be learned that im most exicted to begin learning, one of these things being capture the flag activities.
Although I have never really participated in these activities before, I wanna learn the inner workings of cyber security and learn how to
build a well protected firewall and keep attackers out of it. Hopefully, in my future I want to help companies manage their cyber space from
black hats and keep them secure from external attackers attempting to retrive sensitive information. I would also love to learn how to
manage my own accounts on different services more efficiently and keep those accounts safe. Knowing that the internet is not always a reliable
place, I want to begin making it a safe place for people to enjoy their time instead of worrying about their information being stolen. Although 
I do not have a spot in the field currently, I am looking to begin with this large step to start working people from this field and learn from the 
ground up to begin it.
